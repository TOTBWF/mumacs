;;; Commentary:
;; `agda2-mode' is a bit tricky to manage.  The version of Agda in use is
;; tied to a specific version of `agda2-mode'; this can cause problems when
;; working with multiple versions of Agda.  This gets particularly bad when
;; `nix' gets involved, as the `agda2-mode' files we need will be located
;; inside of the `nix' store.
;;
;; This leads us to the following hack of a configuration, which hard-codes
;; paths left and right.  This works for now, but is not sustainable in the
;; long term.  I've attempted some other solutions (see 90b32ce) but nothing
;; has quite worked out.
